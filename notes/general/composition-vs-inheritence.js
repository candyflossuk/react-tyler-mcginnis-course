// Instead of thinking in terms of what things are, what if we think in terms
// of what they do?

// Use Object.assign to merge the state of an objects with some methods

// By favoring composition over inheritence and thinking
// about what objects do rather than what things are, we are free of fragile
// and tightly coupled inheritence structures.

// This is also known as the functional instantiation pattern, not involving
// the prototype pattern at all.
