Webpack - Into Notes

Why does webpack exist?
> Module bundler
> Creates depedency graph
> Puts them all together into one or more bundles

Intelligently creates a bundle:
> Means you dont need to worry about script order

Webpack can make transformations on your bundle too

Popular:
JS -> Babel use babel loader

Commands run:
npm init
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
npm install svg-inline-loader --save-dev
npm install css-loader --save-dev
npm install style-loader --save-dev
npm install babel-loader --save-dev
npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev


1. webpack grabs the entry point
2. examines all import and require - creating dependency graph
3. webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path
we have a loader for, transforms code according to that loader and
adds to bundle
4. takes final bundle and outputs to file specified.

Plugins:
After the bundle has been created - you can execute tasks

HTMLWebpackPlugin
> Generates an index.html page puts it in our /dist folder with <script> tags
that references the new bundle

Environment Plugin
> Webpack provides environment plugin (no need to download - and removes dev stuff like warnings)


npm run build // runs build for production
npm run start // developmenet build and run on Local

webpack DevServer is a dev server for webpack
dosnt generate /dist stores file in cache, live reload
